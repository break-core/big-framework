# BIG Framework
This is a matching line-for-line decompilation of BIG Framework, a proprietary game framework created by BIG Games.

Unlike most versions of BIG Framework that people use (which is raw decompiled code), this version targets "BIG Framework 2", an internal rewrite of BIG Framework that completely changes the layout and usage of BIG Framework.

The goal of this project is to create a completely readable version of BIG Framework 2 that developers can easily view or take inspiration that matches the original code as well as possible (L4L, or Line for Line)

# How ethical is this?
To match a piece of code line-for-line in the specific version this repository uses, please message me in private if you know who I am beyond Github and I can provide you with the proper files.

To answer the question, we believe that this is fully ethical. Read below for more information. In summary:

- We are reverse-engineering, **not** leaking the BIG Framework. 
- We are not attempting to use this to compete, create competition, influence, or persuade anyone to use this code.

# Info used in the decompilation
All decompilation info present here was obtained via Roblox itself, and My Restaurant reverse engineering. Nothing illegal if it was obtained from the client itself, lol.

# How did we get some of the information (e.g comments)?

In March 2022, Roblox faced a very strange bug. Some games were randomly "uncopylocked" (made open-source) for a VERY short amount of time (reportedly 5-10m). During this time, a user was able to download a fully-functional version of a game made by BIG Games, called "My Restaurant". The file the user downloaded was shortly leaked after. We were able to get certain parts (comments) as apart of this code. **HOWEVER**, we are NOT using any leaked & functioning code in this project. The working code was reverse-engineered by a skilled group of individuals.

# What is the scope of this project?
The scope is to mainly work on fully decompiling the shared code and the client framework code. The server framework code is completely out of reach, as we only have access to the server version of the networking.
