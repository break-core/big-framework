# BIG Framework
This is a matching line-for-line decompilation of BIG Framework, a proprietary game framework created by BIG Games.

Unlike most versions of BIG Framework that people use (which is raw decompiled code), this version targets "BIG Framework 2", an internal rewrite of BIG Framework that completely changes the layout and usage of BIG Framework.

The goal of this project is to create a completely readable version of BIG Framework 2 that developers can easily add into their game that matches the original code as well as possible (L4L, or Line for Line)

# How ethical is this?
To match a piece of code line-for-line in the specific version this repository uses, please message me in private if you know who I am beyond Github and I can provide you with the proper files.

# Info used in the decompilation
All decompilation info present here was obtained via Roblox itself, and My Restaurant reverse engineering. Nothing illegal if it was obtained from the client itself, lol.

# What is the scope of this project?
The scope is to mainly work on fully decompiling the shared code and the client framework code. The server framework code is completely out of reach, as we only have access to the server version of the networking.
